This package provides simulated tree inventory datasets that can be used to calculate the dynamics of tree plots.

## Available datasets

* IFNtrees
* IFNseedlings
* IFNsaplings

## Demographic traits

The demographic traits that are required to run the \cite{fpm} software is described elsewhere. Namely, to run the model one must previously compute the following functions:

* adult survival,
* adult growth, conditioned on survival,
* adult ingrowth, and
* seedling and sapling dynamics.
